            <button class="accordion">Overview</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>This site is the showcase for the CIT 190 term project. It features three interactive games themed
                    mostly around cats. Because cats are cool, and why not?</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Audience</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The target audience for these games are anyone who enjoys cats, passing the time with puzzles, or
                    playing racing games or other classic games.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Design and Interface</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The design for the site is modern and minimal; I did not want a flashy page, and I wanted to make
                    sure the colors were warm and inviting. I used shadings of brown and salmon as a nod to the coloring
                    of calico cats and one of their favorite foods. <br /> <br />I chose to have a static navigation bar
                    across all pages that indicates which page is currently active which will guide users easily on how
                    to access a different game, or return to the home page. For interactivity, on each page, I am
                    implementing
                    an accordion drop-down for users to access information in a way that won't clutter the page, and
                    encourages users to engage with the content. The layout is responsive and should resize with the
                    window without compromising the display of
                    information. </p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">Coding Issues</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>I had some difficulties figuring out how to keep the current page shown as active; after some
                    digging, I was able to solve this by creating and adding an "active" class to the css, and then
                    adding that class to the appropriate nav-list item on each corresponding HTML page.<br />
                    <br />Another problem that I am still trying to solve is having the "how to play" accordions be
                    expanded by default, but then allow the user to collapse them when they're done reading the
                    instructions, but that is still in progress. If I can't figure it out, I will pivot and display the
                    instructions another way, such as having an "instructions" tab and a "game" tab that the user can
                    click between.
