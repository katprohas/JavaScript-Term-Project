	OVERVIEW
--------------------------
This site is the showcase for the CIT 190 term project. It features three interactive games themed mostly around cats and things that I like. 
1 - jigsaw puzzles
2 - cat pong
3 - obstacle course

--------------------------
	GAME 1
--------------------------
Game 1 is a classic puzzle game. Select the image you want to load, and drag and drop the pieces to form the puzzle. 

|| Current Issues ||
- I would like to figure out how to randomize the puzzle pieces using javascript. However, because I have created "puzzle" shapes, it seems quite difficult to implement at this time. 
- I am also having trouble with the accordion drop-down not always working when a puzzle is open, not sure why though. Maybe conflicting js code?

--------------------------
	GAME 2
--------------------------
Game 2 is a version of Pong, but with cats! Player 1 will play against the computer; first to 5 points wins. 

|| Current Issues ||
- I am having trouble importing the yarn ball and setting up angle movements.
